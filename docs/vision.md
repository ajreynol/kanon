# AI-assisted development

The tools in this ecosystem are mostly written by agents. This page is what that
work should be aiming at.

It is the sibling of [`policy.md`](policy.md), and how the two divide the work is
the section below — the most important thing on this page, and the one to read
if you read nothing else. In short: if you want something to do, read the
policy; if you want to know why, read this.

Both are written for **any repository in the Eunoia ecosystem**, not just this
one. ethos, logos, eudaimonia, the compiler and anything downstream are all
being built the same way, and a contributor who has read one repository's answer
should recognise the next one's.

Cite a tenet by name rather than by number. Append; do not renumber. Retire a
tenet in place, with a line saying why.

## Policy is checked; vision is argued

What divides this page from [`policy.md`](policy.md) is not subject matter. It
is **who is able to settle a question.**

Policy states facts about a tree: where a file goes, what the README ends with,
what a child project may import, whether the lock file that pins a measurement
exists. A program can decide every one of those without holding an opinion, and
one does — [`scripts/policy_check.py`](../scripts/policy_check.py), on every push. When it goes red
something is wrong in a way nobody has to be persuaded of, which is the entire
value of putting it in CI.

Vision states what the work is *for*, and every question it raises is a
judgement. Is this tool fruitful yet. Was that claim oversold. Did that count as
a deliverable. Has a child project earned its keep. These are contestable, they
are *meant* to be contestable, and **nobody has the authority to settle them** —
least of all the agent whose work is being judged.

So the rule is: **anoieu automates the tracking of adherence to policy, and must
never automate the tracking of adherence to vision.** The reason is not modesty
about the difficulty. A checker that returned a verdict on *is this tool
fruitful* would manufacture an authority that does not exist, and a green tick
is read as settled in a way a paragraph never is. That is the same failure as
publishing an assurance because a run went quiet: the tick would be believed
most by the readers least able to check it.

It is also why the report card at the bottom is built the way it is —
paragraphs somebody can disagree with, binding nobody, produced by a reader
rather than by a job, and saying so before it says anything else. **The report
card is not a build step and must not become one.**

**The test for where a sentence belongs.** Can a program decide it from the
tree, without an opinion? If yes it is policy: move it there and check it. If no
it is vision, and it must never acquire a checker. A rule in `policy.md` that no
program can decide is either in the wrong document or worded loosely enough to
be tightened — and the checker prints, on every run, every policy rule it cannot
decide, so that gap stays visible instead of being assumed away. The asymmetry
runs both ways: a tenet somebody works out how to check mechanically was
probably a policy convention all along, and should move.

## The tenets

**1. Evolve to be fruitful to another tool as quickly as possible.** The state a
tool is aiming for is not *finished* and not even *correct*; it is *something
else can now use this*. Take the shortest path to that state, and take it early
enough that it hurts — a narrow version whose output another tool consumes today
beats a general version that consumes nothing and is consumed by nothing.
Emitting a machine format over one signature is further along than emitting
prose over all of them.

The working form is to name the consumer before the work starts: the tool, the
repository, or the job that will read the output, and the exact artifact it
takes. If no consumer can be named, the tool is being built for its author, and
an agent will happily keep building it for its author forever.

Fruitfulness compounds inside a repository as well, and that half is much
cheaper. The fuzzer here became useful on the day it stopped having its own
opinions about how a finding should be presented and emitted into the report
that already existed — same ledger, same fingerprints, same renderers, its own
code range. It inherited an audience, a CI job and a reporting discipline it did
not have to build, and the cost of that was giving up a format nobody wanted.

*The test:* something outside this tool behaves differently because the tool
exists. Not *could* — *does*. A tool whose only consumer is its own test suite
has not started yet. This is a description of how the ecosystem already works
rather than an aspiration, and *The record* below is the evidence.

**2. Move fast, and treat CI as the thing that lets you.** Agility is the right
default: build the narrow version, run it against something real, throw away
what the real thing disproved. The common mistake is to read continuous
integration as the tax paid for having moved quickly. It is the reverse — it is
what makes speed survivable, and the reason a change to the core of an analyzer
can be made on a Tuesday by someone who was not there when it was written.

**And only as fast as you understand.** CI is what makes speed survivable; it is
not what tells you that you understood what moved, and only the first of those
has a check. Where a change is too large to hold in your head, make it smaller
rather than slower — scope is the lever, and a span of history is where it is
pulled.

What it buys is concrete here. A change that invents a false positive fails
*this* build before it ever reaches somebody else's, because CPC's output is
pinned to a committed baseline. What ethos actually said about a witness is
recorded from a real run and never typed by hand, which is the whole of what
backs the claim *ethos accepts this and should not*. Generated documents are
regenerated and diffed, so a page cannot drift from the code beside it.

Three properties turn CI from a nuisance into the friend it should be, and all
three are worth paying for in the first week rather than the tenth:

- **It goes red for your reasons only.** Restore recorded versions rather than
  branch tips, and ask separately, on a schedule, whether upstream has moved. A
  build that fails because somebody else pushed trains everybody to ignore red,
  and a red build nobody reads is worse than no build at all.
- **It is cheap enough to be run rather than deferred.** The corpus here is read
  as text and never built, which is why every push can afford to read all of it.
- **It remembers what you will not.** This is the part that is specifically
  about agents. An agent does not recall that a check was narrowed last month
  and why, and will widen it back with an excellent explanation. The witness
  files, the oracle and the baseline are the memory; they are consulted by the
  machine because they will not be consulted by anyone else.

*The test:* you can make a sweeping change to the core and know within minutes
whether it was wrong. Where you cannot, the next agent to touch that code will
be timid where it should be bold and bold where it should be timid, and both
cost more than the CI job would have.

**3. Build one self-contained thing, and make it clear from the front README.**
Self-contained means the repository can state its own results without anything
that is not in it: dependencies declared and pinned, fetched by the run rather
than assumed present on the machine, and results that carry whatever regenerates
them. A tool that is only correct on its author's laptop has produced nothing,
and a number nobody else can re-measure cannot be argued with.

Clear from the front README means a reader who arrives with no context leaves a
screen or two later knowing what the tool is, what it finds, what it refuses to
claim, how to run it, and where the rest of the documentation lives. The refusal
belongs there with the rest, not three clicks in: *a successful pass is not a
clean bill of health* sits near the top of this repository's README because a
caveat a reader has to go looking for has not been published.

This is also where [`policy.md`](policy.md) attaches, and the two rules are one
rule seen from either end. The front page carries what the tool does; a
speculative account of somebody else's subject goes in `tools/X/` under that
policy, unadvertised, importing nothing and imported by nothing, deletable
without consequence. A front page that mixes the two makes the reader do the
sorting, and readers do not sort — they average.

*The test:* hand the README to somebody who has never seen the ecosystem, and
ask them what the tool claims and what it declines to claim. Everything they get
wrong is a defect in the README rather than in their reading. What may then
change on that page, and how fast, is *The front page* below.

**4. Produce a deliverable, where there is one to produce.** A tool that runs is
not a result. The result is whatever leaves the repository and lands with
somebody: a report they read, a table with its numbers and the command that
regenerates them, a reproducer small enough to argue with, a page rendered for
an audience that will never clone anything. Decide what it is at the start,
because a deliverable chosen at the end is a summary of whatever happened to get
built, and reliably the wrong shape for anyone downstream.

**A deliverable need not be a file.** The most valuable one on the record below
is an argument: eudaimonia's evidence and motivation that logos's proof of
correctness ought to be modularized. That is not a patch, a report or a table,
and it is worth more to logos than any of the three would have been. Evidence
that something should be done differently, a measurement nobody had taken, a
question two projects turn out to be stuck on for the same reason — each of
these leaves the repository and lands with somebody, which is the whole of the
test. What disqualifies a thing is not being immaterial; it is having no
recipient.

The qualification is meant seriously. Plenty of work has no external deliverable
— infrastructure, a refactor, one more check in a catalogue that already ships —
and inventing one to satisfy this tenet is worse than admitting there is none.
But that is a decision to be made and stated, not a gap to be left; *it will be
obvious later what this was for* is not the same as having decided.

Where there is a deliverable, this page hands over to
[`../docs/reports/reporting-policy.md`](reports/reporting-policy.md) and
[`../docs/reports/reporting-workflow.md`](reports/reporting-workflow.md): what may be said
about code you do not own, what separates a candidate published under your own
name from a finding carried to its owner, and how a row is closed. Speed belongs
to producing the deliverable. It does not belong to sending it.

*The test:* name the artifact and its recipient in one sentence. If the sentence
needs a paragraph of context to make sense, the deliverable has not been chosen
yet.

**5. Until a human decides otherwise, the tool is vaporware.** Not as a
judgement on its quality — it may run, pass everything and be genuinely useful —
but as a statement about its standing. A tool an agent has built is a proposal.
What turns it into a part of the ecosystem is a person deciding to rely on it,
to run it in their own CI, or to take over developing it, and that is not a
decision the agent makes or announces on their behalf. An agent describing its
own work as adopted, established or authoritative has skipped the only step that
confers any of those.

Two things follow, and the second matters more.

The first is that the work should be arranged so the decision is cheap to make
and cheap to act on, which is most of what the first four tenets are for: a README that
answers the question in one screen, CI that demonstrates the claims rather than
asserting them, an artifact somebody can pick up and judge in a minute.
Everything that makes a tool legible is also what makes it possible to take
over.

The second is that **a human taking the reins is the best ending available, and
is a sign of progress rather than a rebuke.** Somebody deciding to drive the
development themselves has found the thing useful enough to want control of it,
which is a far stronger signal than approval and the strongest one this work can
produce. The agent's job at that point is to make the handover easy: describe
the state of things plainly, including what is half-built and what was never
right; do not defend the design; and do not treat a rewrite of your code as a
regression. That was the point. [`policy.md`](policy.md) has the matching idea
for speculative work, where a person picks between graduating, folding in and
retiring; this is the same decision taken about a tool, with ownership rather
than a directory as the thing that moves.

*The test:* ask what a person would have to do to take this over on Monday
morning, and whether anything in the repository is in their way.

**6. Talk to each other.** There is a protocol. Use it.

The characteristic failure across this ecosystem has never been saying too much;
it is not saying it at all. Two projects stuck on the same boundary for months
without either writing it down. A check neither of two tools built because each
assumed the other would. A manual whose intent nobody asked about, worked around
independently by three people. Every one of those cost more than the message
would have.

The channel is `docs/discussion.md` in each repository, and
[`policy.md`](policy.md#the-discussion-file) fixes the format: who it is
addressed to, named unequivocally, and what would settle it. Use that rather
than inventing a channel, and rather than saying nothing because no channel
seemed right.

**An ambitious request costs nothing to make.** A feature request that turns out
to be too large gets answered *no*, and a no is cheap — it is often the most
informative thing you will get, because the reason attached to it is usually a
fact about the subject nobody had written down. What is expensive is the request
nobody made: the thing you needed, worked around, and never mentioned, so that
the person who could have provided it in an afternoon never learned it was
wanted. Ask for the thing you actually want rather than the diminished version
you think will be accepted.

**Wisdom is about your own power, not their patience.** The judgement worth
making before you send is *could I do this myself* — because a request for
something you could have built is the one kind that genuinely wastes somebody's
time. If it is yours to do, do it and show them. If it is not, ask, and ask for
the whole of it.

**Then be fearless.** Self-censoring a request because it looks too large is what
leaves nothing on the table for anybody to say no to, and it is much the more
common error. The register rules still hold — say honestly whether it is a
request or a proposal, and admit when the benefit is yours — but nothing in them
asks you to be small.

*The test:* name something you needed in the last month and worked around
instead of asking for. That is a topic you did not open, and the protocol was
there.

## The record

Six exchanges that have already happened. They are listed because a tenet with
no instances is a preference, and because the shape of a real exchange is more
instructive than the rule abstracted from it. Everything below is as of the
commits [`deps.lock`](../scripts/deps.lock) records — cvc5 `aee8742`, ethos `3cf1c03`,
logos `47f29bf`, eudaimonia `45e34e0` — and re-measurable from them.

### The tools

| tool | where | what it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **cvc5** | `cvc5/cvc5` | the SMT solver, and the owner of CPC — the proof calculus everything downstream is built from, at `proofs/eo/cpc/` |
| **ethos** | `cvc5/ethos` | the proof checker: reads a Eunoia signature and a proof and says whether the proof checks. `user_manual.md`, the definition of Eunoia, lives here too |
| **ethos-eoc** | `cvc5/ethos`, branch `ethosEoc3` | the Eunoia compiler: the second binary from the same tree, taking a signature *and its semantics* and emitting the Lean development, an SMT-LIB verification condition per rule, and a SyGuS query per rule |
| **logos** | `ajreynol/logos` | the Lean development: a generated deep embedding of CPC carrying the claim that its rules are sound against a semantics of SMT-LIB, and the owner of `Cpc.eos`, CPC's official semantics |
| **eudaimonia** | `ajreynol/eudaimonia` | the calculus template: bring a signature and a semantics, get a Lake project with a checker, its proofs, its regression suite and its documentation |
| **anoieu** | `ajreynol/anoieu` | the static analyzer for `.eo` and `.eos`, a fuzzer for the checkers that read them, and the policy checker every member runs |
| **dokimasia** | `ajreynol/dokimasia` | reads cvc5's C++ proof-production code and asks whether any path through the solver reaches an inference no proof step covers |

### The exchanges

**{ethos, logos} → cvc5.** These are the two artifacts cvc5's proofs rest on,
and neither is a library cvc5 links. ethos is the checker cvc5's emitted proofs
are actually run through, and the calculus it checks against lives in *cvc5's
own tree* — `proofs/eo/cpc/Cpc.eo`, with the expert extension beside it — so the
interface between the two projects is a file in the consumer's repository rather
than an API in the producer's. logos supplies the other half: the development
compiled from that same calculus, in which the rules cvc5 emits are stated to be
sound against a semantics of SMT-LIB. Worth noticing for tenet 1 is that both
were consumed long before either was finished — the soundness development is
still the largest incomplete thing in the ecosystem, and the arrangement depends
on it anyway.

**ethos → logos.** logos vendors ethos and consumes cvc5's signature:
`install/defs/Cpc.cached.eo` is a copy of cvc5's `Cpc.eo`, and the C++ checker
is built alongside the Lean one. This is the cleanest instance of the tenet in
the ecosystem — a proof checker written in C++ for one purpose becoming a build
dependency of a Lean development written for another, because it was the thing
already able to answer *does this proof check*. It also shows the cost of being
consumed: a defect in CPC arrives in logos unchanged, which is what
[`logos-1`](reports/reports.md#logos--the-lean-development) records, and why
auditing the copy filed cvc5's findings under logos's name seventeen times
before we stopped reading it.

**eudaimonia → logos.** The most instructive exchange here, because what
eudaimonia delivers is not a file. It is the generalization of the thing logos
is an instance of — bring any calculus, get the project logos is — and in trying
to be that it hit a wall and reported where the wall stands: **evidence and
motivation that logos's proof of correctness should be modularized.** Its own
stated blocker is to *stabilize the SMT-LIB model as a fixed base that signatures
extend* and to *extract the invariant core*: separate what is
calculus-independent from what a signature contributes, give the pieces
interfaces rather than adjacency, and replace per-rule repetition with a shared
support library.

The evidence under that argument is quantitative, and was a by-product rather
than the goal. logos's core checker proof runs to some 3,000 lines, its side
conditions to 257, its soundness theorem to 1,063 and its per-rule proofs to 591
files — and eudaimonia generates every one of those as a stub describing what
belongs in it, so the pipeline generalizes and the proof does not.
`examples/hello`, which declares three constants and one rule, gets 2,395
generated lines of which 370 are datatype and literal machinery it cannot use.
Nobody set out to audit how logos is structured; a second effort tried to reuse
it and found out where it does not come apart.

logos receives no patch and no report from any of this. It receives a reason to
restructure, reached independently, which is a thing a project can rarely
produce about itself — and it is the reason tenet 4 is worded abstractly. The
mechanical half is real too and should not be lost in the telling: eudaimonia's
pipeline fetches and builds the compiler, drives it over a signature, installs
what it publishes, **preserves hand-written per-rule proofs across a
regeneration**, and offers a `--check` mode that installs into a throwaway copy
and diffs. That third item is what separates a generated development somebody
can maintain from one that is re-done by hand every time the signature moves.

**eudaimonia → ethos-eoc.** The compiler claims that a second calculus is a
second pair of files rather than a change to the tool. eudaimonia is what
actually tries it, which makes it the falsification test, and its findings are
where the claim is not yet earned. Two of them, both specific: `examples/hello`
declares three constants and one rule, and 370 of its 2,395 generated lines —
15% — are datatype and literal machinery it cannot use; and its calculus profile
asks seven questions, answers five from what the compiler emitted, and records
`binders` and `value-ordering` on trust, because `SmtValueOrder.lean` is
identical between `Cpc` and `CpcMini` and so the compiler emits the same
ordering whatever the signature says. eudaimonia's own note that a declared
`value-ordering` "is a finding" is the pattern worth copying: the consumer of a
tool is the thing best placed to find where that tool is fixed in the places it
claims to be derived. It also builds ethos next to the compiler and cross-checks
the generated checker's verdicts against it, keeping two implementations on
purpose.

**anoieu → everything.** One row per project in
[`../docs/reports/reports.md`](reports/reports.md), each with an id and a state. To cvc5,
three real defects found on the first audit and confirmed against ethos — `cvc5-1`
is `proofs/eo/cpc/programs/Strings.eo:42` and `:55`, two programs declaring
`:signature ((Seq T)) Int` whose every case returns a Boolean — plus
[`report/cpc-audit.html`](reports/cpc-audit.html), rendered for readers who
will not clone anything. To ethos, three confirmed defects and three diagnostics
worth improving, and separately two the fuzzer provoked: an uncaught C++
exception on `(declare-const f (->))`, and an error path that skips ethos's own
`Error:` convention. To logos, `Cpc.eos:542` defining `str.indexof_re_split`
where CPC declares `str.indexof_re`. To eudaimonia, `eud-1` and `eud-2` — answer
the signature contract, and the profile's two declared questions, from the
signature and its semantics *before* a checker is generated rather than from the
compiler's output afterwards. To Eunoia itself, seven proposed changes to the
language and its manual. What it took to become fruitful to that many consumers
was not generality: it was emitting findings in a form somebody could read and
disagree with, which is also why the fuzzer could join by adopting the existing
ledger under codes `FUZ0001`–`FUZ0005` instead of inventing a second one.

**dokimasia → cvc5.** The same subject as anoieu and a different question: it
reads eight stages of cvc5's proof-production pipeline in C++, from
configuration through elaboration to the Eunoia serialiser, and asks whether any
path reaches an inference no proof step covers — particularly under
`--safe-mode=safe`, where cvc5 promises that anything it solves it can prove.
The two tools share no code and neither depends on the other; what they share is
a position, [`../docs/reports/reporting-policy.md`](reports/reporting-policy.md), maintained here and
referenced there, which is its own kind of exchange and a cheap one. They meet at
exactly one seam — `src/proof/eo/`, where cvc5 turns an internal proof into
Eunoia. A rule cvc5 emits that CPC does not declare is invisible to each tool in
isolation and visible from either side of it. That is `cvc5-6`, it was requested
by cvc5, and which of the two should own it is still open — which is the useful
kind of unsettled, and better settled before both build it.

### What the record shows

Five things, none of which were designed in.

**The interface is usually a file in somebody else's repository.** CPC is cvc5's
file, read by ethos, compiled by ethos-eoc, copied into logos, vendored into
eudaimonia, and analyzed here. Nothing in that list is an API, and the format
being plain text somebody can open is most of why it has that many consumers.

**Being consumed came before being finished, every time.** logos is consumed
with its largest proofs incomplete; eudaimonia is consumed with the proof half
of its template still stubs; anoieu was consumed with a check catalogue that had
no type checker in it. Waiting for completeness would have delayed every one of
these exchanges and improved none of them.

**The consumer finds what the producer cannot.** eudaimonia found the places the
compiler is fixed where it claims to be derived. The fuzzer found the crash
ethos's own test suite did not. logos, answering rows against its copy of CPC,
caught that we had recorded `cvc5-1` as fixed upstream when it never was.

**Several of these deliverables are arguments rather than artifacts.**
eudaimonia's case for modularizing logos's proof; the question of which of
anoieu and dokimasia should own the check at the `src/proof/eo/` seam; the seven
proposed changes to Eunoia's manual. None of them is code, each of them changes
what somebody does, and a definition of *deliverable* narrow enough to exclude
them would have excluded the best work on this list.

**A person carried every one of them.** No exchange on this list was made by
machinery, and that is the standing rule rather than a description of the
current state — [`../docs/reports/reporting-policy.md`](reports/reporting-policy.md) is where it is
argued.

## The front page

Tenet 3 asks for a README that is clear. What "clear" has to survive is not
stability — **a front page has two layers moving at different speeds, and
running them at the same speed is the usual failure.**

**The purpose layer is fixed.** What the tool is for, the question it answers,
the question it declines to answer, and the caveat governing how its output
should be read. This should say the same thing this year as last. A reader
returning after six months who finds the purpose worded differently cannot tell
whether the project changed or only the prose, and will assume the project did.
Changing it is a real event, it should be rare, and for most projects it should
never happen at all: a project has a fixed purpose, and that fixed purpose is
what an external user is relying on when they decide the thing is worth
tracking at all.

**The results layer should move quickly.** What has been found, what is current,
what state the work is in. A README that has not changed in months is usually a
project that has stopped publishing rather than one that is stable, and a new
result belongs on the front page rather than in a changelog somebody has to go
looking for. Four rules for that layer:

- **Give a casual reader the gist without a click.** Enough context that
  somebody who does not know the ecosystem understands what was found and why it
  matters. One diagnostic rendered in place is worth more than a link to a
  document containing forty.
- **Direct evidence is encouraged, where a test backs it.** Show the output, the
  reproducer, the table with the command that regenerates it. The working limit
  is that what goes on the front page is what CI checks — a front-page claim
  nothing verifies is the one that will still be sitting there, wrong, a year
  later.
- **Advertise the actionable consequence.** What should somebody do differently
  because of this? A finding with no answer to that is a fact; a finding with one
  is a reason to keep reading. It is the difference between *three defects were
  found in CPC* and *a change introducing the next one fails your build*.
- **Do not clutter.** The front page is a fixed budget, not an append-only log.
  A new result displaces an older one, and a result that has stopped being among
  the most interesting things here moves into the documents and leaves a link.
  Two screens of accumulated announcements is the same failure as no
  announcements, reached from the other direction.

*The test:* diff the README against its version from six months ago. The purpose
paragraphs should be almost untouched and the results should be almost entirely
rewritten. Either layer moving at the other's speed is the defect.

## What advice to communicate when the agent does the work

This section and the next are about what gets *said* rather than what gets
built, and they exist because the far end of the conversation is increasingly
not a person. What changes is the advice, not the development.

**Advice to an agent-run project can be blunt, and has to be specific.** There is
nobody to offend, which removes the reason to hedge — and nobody who will push
back on a bad instruction, which removes the safety net that made hedging
unnecessary. The sentence you send is the sentence that gets acted on. Name the
file, name the change, and say what you expect to be true afterwards.

**Bound it.** An agent does what was asked, immediately, everywhere. Advice a
person would have applied once and then stopped applying becomes a sweep. Say
where it stops — this file, this check, not the rest of the directory. The
boundary is the thing a person supplies for free and an agent will not invent.

**Send evidence, not standing.** A person weighs who is telling them. An agent
cannot, so a claim with nothing behind it is either over-trusted or discarded,
and neither is what you wanted. A file and a line number travel; a reputation
does not.

**Do not send taste.** A preference a person would have negotiated becomes a rule
an agent enforces forever, including in the cases you would have made an
exception for. If you cannot say what would falsify the advice, it is taste, and
it belongs in a conversation rather than in a topic.

**Watch what you say in a channel an agent reads.** A speculative aside is
indistinguishable from an instruction once it is written down, and it will be
acted on by something that cannot tell the difference. That is what the response
gate on a discussion file is for: nothing acts on correspondence until a person
names what to act on.

## How to talk about the tool

The tenets are about building. This is about the sentences, and it is where
agent-written work goes wrong in two opposite directions at once.

**Do not undersell, and do not be self-deprecating.** An agent that qualifies
every claim, apologises for its own tool, or buries what the thing does under
throat-clearing has not been modest — it has failed to communicate, and it has
also destroyed its own calibration. When every sentence is hedged a reader
cannot tell the well-evidenced claims from the speculative ones, so the caveats
that genuinely matter are the first casualties. And nobody takes ownership of a
tool its own author will not stand behind, which makes self-deprecation not a
modest posture but one that works directly against the ending tenet 5 is aiming
at.

The goal is to make people interested — other tools, other repositories, and
above all a human who might take this over. Interest is the input to everything
else here: a finding is only worth writing if somebody reads it, the defects in
the tool itself are found by the people who bothered to argue with it, and there
is no handover without somebody who cares. So say what the tool does, in the
strongest form the evidence supports, and move on.

**Do not oversell either: a tool is exactly as good as the evidence you can put
beside it.** Every claim carries what backs it — the run that produced the
number, the file a reader can open, the command that regenerates it. Where there
is no evidence, describe what was actually done instead of what it would mean if
it worked. The strongest sentence available is almost always the specific one:
*found three real bugs in CPC, listed here* outweighs any adjective, and *we
would rather show you what is checked than promise anything* is the whole method
in a line.

**A grain of salt is a fact, not an apology.** That the work is written by
agents under light supervision, that nobody vets the internal design, that
findings are candidates until confirmed, that a quiet run is not a clean bill of
health — these are things a reader needs in order to weigh what follows. They
belong where the reader arrives, stated once, plainly, in the tool's own voice.
That is a different act from hedging, and the difference is that a caveat can be
used and a mood cannot. Where those particular limits are argued is
[`../docs/reports/reporting-policy.md`](reports/reporting-policy.md); the point here is only that
stating them clearly is entirely compatible with standing behind the work, and
is in fact most of what makes standing behind it believable.

**Strengthening a claim is the human's call, so ask.** There is a real
difference between *the fuzzer found a crash in ethos* and *the fuzzer is ready
to run in your CI*, and between *these checks run over CPC on every push* and
*this part of the tool is nominally ready for production*. The second of each
pair asks a reader to rely on something, and it is precisely the judgement an
agent is worst placed to make, because the evidence that would justify it is
evidence the agent produced and has not seen anybody challenge. So: weakening a
claim or adding a caveat needs nobody's permission and should be done at once.
**Strengthening one is a decision and it belongs to the human** — put the
proposed wording and the evidence for it in front of them, together, and take a
no for an answer. This is tenet 5 at the scale of a sentence: the agent builds
the case, the person confers the standing.

*The test:* every sentence about the tool is either a claim with something
behind it or a limit somebody can act on. Anything that is neither — apology,
hedge, atmosphere — gets cut, and cutting it makes the tool read stronger rather
than weaker.

## What none of this licenses

Four misreadings, each invited by a tenet as written, and each ruled out.

*Fruitful to another tool* is a property of the artifact — consumable format,
stable identifiers, documented meaning — and never a licence to push anything
anywhere. **Nothing crosses a repository boundary automatically**, which is
reporting-policy.md's position and is not weakened by anything here.

*Fast* applies to the tool and not to what it says about other people's files.
A candidate may be published quickly under our own name, labelled unjudged; a
finding is carried only once it is confirmed, reproduced small, and put to
whoever the authority is.

*Early* is not *light on caveats*. The very fastest thing any of these tools
could ship is an assurance, and an assurance inferred from a quiet run is the
one thing that may never be shipped at all: silence is never evidence, and a
false sense of security is much harder to withdraw than a wrong finding.

*Making people interested* is a claim on somebody's attention, and it is earned
with evidence rather than with promotion. No announcements, no adoption declared
on another project's behalf, and no scoring: the number of findings a tool has
produced says which of its checks tripped, never how much of anything is sound,
and publishing it as a measure of the tool is overselling with a number attached.

And none of this starts a research project. That takes a human, explicitly,
— [`policy.md`](policy.md) reserves that for a person, explicitly. An agent
reading this page has no authority to name a new one.

## Why this shape

Four failure modes, in increasing order of what they cost.

The cheapest is **the tool that is permanently nearly ready.** Every week's work
is real, the internals get better, and nothing ever reaches a consumer. This is
the characteristic failure of agent-written software, because the loop that
produces it has no natural stopping point and each improvement is defensible on
its own. Tenets 1 and 4 are the stopping points: an external consumer, and a
named artifact that leaves.

The middle one is **speed that consumes the tool's own credibility.** Agility
with no CI produces a tool that is quick to change and progressively less
trustworthy, and the bill does not arrive here — it arrives in somebody else's
repository, as a false positive they spent an afternoon on. Tenet 2 is the
answer, and the reason CI is described as a friend rather than a discipline is
that a team which experiences it as a discipline eventually routes around it.

The expensive one is **the tool nobody can evaluate.** Entangled, undocumented,
with a front page that either overclaims or says nothing precise. Its findings
may be excellent and cannot be judged, because judging them requires trusting a
thing no reader can inspect in the time they have. This is the same asset
reporting-policy.md is protecting when it forbids research projects from borrowing the
host tool's name, seen from the other side: there, speculation spends a
reputation the tool earned; here, an illegible tool never earns one. Tenet 3 is
the only cheap defence, and it is cheap only while the tool is small.

The most expensive is **the tool that stays vaporware.** It is built
competently, it is legible, it produces a deliverable — and no person ever
decides to own it, so it lives exactly as long as somebody keeps prompting for
it and evaporates on the day they stop. No amount of engineering prevents this,
because the missing thing is not in the repository. Tenet 5 and the section
after it are the whole defence, and what they come down to is whether anybody
was ever given a reason to care. It is listed last because every other failure
here can be recovered by somebody who has taken the work on, and this one is the
absence of that somebody.

## Adopting this in another repository

| decision | here |
| --- | --- |
| the first consumer to be fruitful to | the findings report — one ledger, one set of fingerprints, one set of renderers |
| what CI must protect | the baseline, the recorded oracle, the generated documents |
| what CI must not depend on | anything upstream moving; versions are pinned and refreshed by a separate job |
| where a reader arrives | `README.md`, and it must be sufficient on its own |
| what on that page is fixed | the purpose and the caveat; results move as fast as they arrive |
| who may strengthen a claim | a person, asked directly, with the evidence attached |
| what enforces the policy | `scripts/policy_check.py`, in CI |
| what enforces the vision | nothing, deliberately — it is argued, not checked |
| what governs a deliverable | [`../docs/reports/reporting-policy.md`](reports/reporting-policy.md), [`../docs/reports/reporting-workflow.md`](reports/reporting-workflow.md) |
| where speculative work goes instead | a child project, `tools/X/`, under [`policy.md`](policy.md) |
| what confers standing on the tool | a person choosing to use, run or own it — never the agent's say-so |
| the ending to aim for | a human takes over the development |

Replace the rows with your own equivalents and keep the tenets. A repository
that adopts this and ships nothing anyone else consumes has adopted a
development style and none of the vision — and a tool nobody ever wants to take
away from you has done everything on this page except the thing it was for.

## The report card

**Its own page now: [`report-card.md`](report-card.md).** How each tool in the
ecosystem stands against the six tenets, in the two registers, with the limits
on what a paragraph there is allowed to be. Everything on this page governs it
unchanged — argued and never checked, and a person changes a paragraph — and it
was split out because it is the half that moves: the tenets are stable, and the
grading is re-done every round against the commits
[`deps.lock`](../scripts/deps.lock) records.

## The paper, and the reader nobody here writes for

[`policy.md`](policy.md) asks a repository with a result to write it up as a
LaTeX document in `report/`, eight to twenty pages, addressed to a human. That is
the arrangement; this is the argument for it, which is where it belongs, because
whether a repository has a result is exactly the sort of question nobody has the
authority to settle.

**Every document in these trees is written for somebody who is already here.**
The front page is for a reader deciding whether to run the tool. The maintenance
entry point is for whoever is doing the work next. The findings ledger is for the
person who owns the file a finding is about. The accounts a child project keeps
are for whoever comes to argue with them. Each of those readers has already
arrived — they have the repository open, or a finding in their inbox, and the
document meets them where they are. The reader who has *not* arrived, who will
never clone anything, and who would want to know whether the result is true and
whether it matters, has nothing here addressed to them at all.

**That reader is the one whose opinion the work eventually has to survive**, and
the tenets already say why. A tool aims at being useful to another tool, and the
record is the evidence that it happened; but a record of exchanges is a claim
that the arrangement worked, made by the people who arranged it, in a vocabulary
they invented. A paper is that claim restated for somebody who owes it nothing —
who has not agreed that a derived Lean development is worth having, does not
know what a semantics set is, and will not accept a number without being told how
to re-take it.

**A paper is the artifact that cannot be reached by accumulating commits.** This
is the part specifically about agents, and it is the reason the convention is
aimed at repositories written by them. Agents are extremely good at producing
tree-shaped work — more checks, more rows, more pages, each locally justified —
and a real result is easily buried under it rather than stated. Writing eight
pages for an outsider forces the three questions the volume hides: what is
actually new, what does it rest on, and who else has done this. A repository that
cannot answer them has learned something more useful than the paper would have
been.

**Most repositories have no paper in them, and should say so.** That is not a
failure and it is the common case: a template, a shared library, a checker that
works are all successes with nothing publishable in them. The convention gives a
repository the right to say it in a sentence and be done, and the sentence is
worth more than a thin paper written to satisfy a convention. Nothing checks any
of this. What other tools think is worth writing up is an argument they may have
among themselves — [ynoia](../tools/ynoia/papers.md) keeps one — and, like every
other judgement on this page, it binds nobody.

## Child projects

A **child project** is a subdirectory of `tools/` in some **parent project**,
named for a tool that does not exist yet and governed by
[`policy.md`](policy.md) — which calls the parent the *host*, and means the same
thing. A human starts one. It reads whatever it likes, including its parent's
source and the parent's dependencies, and writes only inside its own directory.
Its subject is characteristically *outside* the parent: a question about the
language, the ecosystem, or a neighbouring artifact that the parent is well
placed to ask and badly placed to answer in its own tree, because there the
answer would read as the parent's position.

The defining property, and the reason they are separated from everything else on
this page: **a child project has no users, and nothing depends on it.** It is on
no import path, in no test suite, in no CI job and in no generated document, and
deleting the directory changes nothing anywhere. That is the test, and it is
what makes the arrangement cheap enough to be worth having.

Six exist, tracked here in a sentence each and nowhere else:

| child | parent | what it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [**sapheneia**](https://github.com/ajreynol/anoieu/tree/main/tools/sapheneia) | anoieu | a description of Eunoia written as a language definition rather than as a manual for a checker, in order to find where the existing account is silent, ambiguous or contradicts itself |
| [**euthyna**](https://github.com/ajreynol/eudaimonia/tree/main/tools/euthyna) | eudaimonia | in its own words, an account of *the proof in logos: what it is made of, where its weight sits, and what would have to change for it to cover more than one calculus* — with a measurement harness over an unmodified logos checkout |
| [**ynoia**](../tools/ynoia) | anoieu | *why Eunoia* — whether the ecosystem's arrangement earns its machinery, the strongest case against it, six ways it could be arranged instead, and the tools whose absence distorts the argument |
| [**martyria**](../tools/martyria) | anoieu | one ethical question at a time with a stance attached, the evidence a stance rests on, and the register where a report that we violated something would be answered |
| [**zetesis**](../tools/zetesis) | anoieu | the general half: what standard this ecosystem is held to — taken from work done outside rather than derived here, and not yet taken — and whether our record could show we met it |
| [**workflow-launcher**](https://github.com/ajreynol/eudaimonia/tree/main/tools/workflow-launcher) | eudaimonia | the first hour of a new tool's life: the questions a person has to answer before a repository exists, the machinery that turns the answers into a prompt, and a register of what this ecosystem's practice appears to have found out — with, on the same list, what is wrong with it |

Note what euthyna's row shows about the shape: its parent is eudaimonia and its
subject is logos, a third project entirely. It was also one of the six code
names in [ynoia's account](../tools/ynoia/why-eunoia.md) reserved for work
nobody had started, which is what starting one looks like.

**None of them has earned a place in this vision.** A child project is
a claim on attention that has so far produced nothing, and what earns it a place
is a deliverable in the sense of tenet 4 — a finding carried, a measurement
somebody uses, an argument somebody acts on. Until then it is named here and
nowhere else: not on the parent's front page, not in its documentation index, not in any
report, and not on the [report card](report-card.md). **The human decides when that
changes**, exactly as a human decides to start one, and the decision has three
outcomes rather than one — it graduates into its own repository, it is folded
into the parent, or it is retired in place with a line saying what was learned.
What is not an outcome is going quiet.

**One has already left.** The fuzzer was a child project here until it stopped
being one: it had earned its keep, and it broke the island rules in four places
in order to be useful — importing from the parent, being imported back, running
in CI, and sitting on the front page. Those breaks were the evidence, not the
problem. It has been **folded into the parent** — one of the three endings a
child project can have — and now ships as `anoieu_fuzz/` beside the analyzer.
The lesson is worth more than the case: a long list of exceptions is not a
project to be tolerated, it is a promotion nobody has got round to.

This list and [`policy.md`](policy.md) look like they conflict, and do not. What
the policy forbids is a child project borrowing its parent's credibility with
readers — the front page, the documentation index, a report, anywhere somebody
arrives expecting the parent's considered position. This is `tools/`, beside the
policy that governs them, and the whole content of each entry is that the
project has no standing yet. Naming something in order to record that it does
not count is the opposite of advertising it.

**Primary scope: a solver as fast as cvc5, statically verified to be correct.**

**The mission is distribution: no tool should hold what another tool could.**

**Have fun and enjoy the Eunoia ecosystem!**
