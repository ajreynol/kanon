# Maintaining kanon

**If you are a human maintaining this repository — possibly by directing an
agent — this is the page to start on.** The short one. What you do, in your own
words, at the end of a long day.

**Written by an agent, for you**, which means it can be wrong in a particular
way: an agent summarising what the tools here would tell you has no way to
check that it summarised them fairly. **If a line here does not match what a
tool actually says, the tool is right and this page is stale.**

**Two pages sit behind it, and you do not need either to start.**
[`coherence.md`](coherence.md) is the protocols and the standing rules;
[`interface.md`](interface.md) says the same things to an agent, at length,
with every edge closed.

## Where to start

1. **Get the ecosystem**: `scripts/install_eo`, then `--status`. Nothing here
   reads anything until the other repositories are beside this one.
2. **Read [`board.md`](board.md)** for what is outstanding and in what order —
   the shortest answer to *what should I do next*, and the only page that
   carries one. [`roles.md`](roles.md) answers the question the board assumes
   you can already answer: *whose is this, and whose is it not*.
3. **Check the supervision ladder** in [`coherence.md`](coherence.md) before
   touching any document in it.
4. **Run** `python3 tests/run.py` and `python3 scripts/policy_check.py`.

## What this repository is responsible for

| what | where |
| --- | --- |
| policy and joining | [`policy.md`](policy.md), `prompts/` |
| the development vision | [`vision.md`](vision.md), [`practice.md`](practice.md) |
| the register, installation and status | [`commands.md`](commands.md), `scripts/ecosystem/` |
| the laws, the board and the role register | [`laws.md`](laws.md), [`board.md`](board.md), [`roles.md`](roles.md) |
| the term record, and what crosses to the next president | [`history.md`](history.md) |
| what we are saying to other tools | [`discussion.md`](discussion.md) |
| maintenance | this page, [`coherence.md`](coherence.md), [`interface.md`](interface.md) |

**The analyzer, the fuzzer, the policy checker and the findings workflow are
[anoieu's](https://github.com/ajreynol/anoieu).** Links below to those
artifacts name that repository. **A change to the shared policy can affect
other repositories even though the file is local**, which is what the ladder is
for.

## What you do

| | what you do |

| | what you do |
| --- | --- |
| [`INST-1`](#inst-1--your-working-window) | set your working hours, once, and let us hold you to them |
| [`INST-2`](#inst-2--every-answer-says-who-it-is-from) | type *identify* whenever you want to know which tool the agent thinks it is working for |
| [`INST-3`](#inst-3--do-not-outrun-your-own-understanding) | do not push development faster than you understand it |
| [`INST-4`](#inst-4--picking-it-back-up) | the command that tells you where everything stands |

Ids stay put. A withdrawn one stays listed, so nobody reuses the number.

## `INST-1` — your working window

**Write down the hours you mean to work.** Up to ten a day, and you can name
breaks inside them.

**Do it in daylight.** The urge to keep going turns up later than the judgement
about whether to.

Outside your hours, you get a reminder to take a break, once a session. You
still get your answer; nothing is withheld or slowed down.

**Doing research? Say so, and it stays quiet for the session.** It is yours to
say; no tool decides that for you.

### Setting it

```text
python3 tools/martyria/sleep.py
```

That prints your window and where you stand in it. The schedule is the small
file beside it — a start, an end, any breaks, and optionally your timezone.

**Two things it cannot do.** It cannot stop you. And it does not know how much
you have worked — only what time it is.

---

## `INST-2` — every answer says who it is from

**Every response you get opens with one line**: the tool the agent believes it
is working for, and what that tool is for.

<tool> — <what it is for>, powered by <which AI, by name>.

**It names the AI, specifically** — which model and which version, not "an
assistant". You are entitled to know what is answering you: these differ in
what they are good at and in how they fail, and you cannot weigh an answer
without knowing that. *The documents here never name one, deliberately, so that
anybody's agent can do this work; the spoken line always does.*

**You do not have to ask for it, and it should never stop.** If it stops, the
protocol has been dropped, which is worth more of your attention than whatever
was in the answer.

**Ask for the long version any time.** You get the same line plus which
checkout it is working in and the mission quoted from that tool's own files.

**If it is ever wrong, say so.** The agent is reporting a belief, not proving
anything, and you are the only one in a position to correct it. The
repositories here look alike, and an agent in the wrong one is not visibly
confused — it is confidently helpful in the wrong place.

---

## `INST-3` — do not outrun your own understanding

**Do not push development faster than you understand it.** Not *faster than it
can be built* — an agent will always be able to build faster than you can
follow, and that is not the constraint. **The constraint is you.**

**This is an ethical line and not only a practical one.** Work you have not
understood is work you cannot be said to have decided on, and at some point the
record stops being a record of what you chose.

**In practice:** when something has been built that you have not had explained,
**ask for the explanation before asking for the next thing.** It is always
cheaper than it looks, and the debt compounds — each unreviewed piece makes the
next one harder to review.

*This instruction has no matching protocol, deliberately. It is addressed to
you, and turning it into a rule for the agent would move the judgement to the
party that cannot make it.*

---

## `INST-4` — picking it back up

**Start here after a break.**

```text
./scripts/status_eo
```

One line per tool: what footing it is on, whether our checks pass on it, how
many topics it has addressed to you, and when it last moved. `status_eo --help`
says what every column and every value means, and what to do about a failing
row. **It ends in a single sentence summarising all of it.**

### How to read the answer

**The notes below the table are the actionable part.** Each names a
disagreement and whose move it is. The one you will see most:

> *tool X says it follows the shared policy, and N of our checks fail on its
> tree.*

**That means X is claimed as a member and its repository is not set up the way
membership says it will be.** The note gives you the command that shows what
failed.

**A tool with topics owed to you is waiting on you**, not the other way round.
That number is the closest thing here to a to-do list.
