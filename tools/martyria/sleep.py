"""Is the human supposed to be working right now?

**The end goal of this file is one sentence spoken to a person: take a break.**
Everything else here exists to make that sentence land at the right time and to
leave a trace when the window it rests on is moved.

**It decides nothing and enforces nothing.** The human can edit the schedule,
ignore the answer, or delete this file. What it can do is say what the window
is, say whether we are inside it, and record when the window last changed --
because a window widened at one in the morning is the interesting event, and an
unrecorded one is invisible.

**Never run this in CI.** It is a fact about a clock, not about a tree: it says
something different every hour, so a build hanging off it would fail for reasons
that have nothing to do with the code. It shares that property, and that rule,
with `scripts/bump_check.py`.

Exit codes, so a shell can branch on it:

    0   awake   -- inside the window, and not on a declared break
    1   sleep   -- outside the window, or on a break inside it
    2   refused -- the schedule is not one this tool will report on

**A break and a night are the same event to everything downstream**, which is
why they share an exit code: both mean *not now*. They are told apart in what
gets said, because "take a break" and "you are on one" are different sentences
to be on the receiving end of.

#: ## How this file decides what time it is
#:
#: **The short version: `zoneinfo` from the standard library, an IANA name in
#: the schedule, and no dependency added.** The long version is here because
#: getting a local hour right is a well-known source of quiet wrongness, and a
#: tool whose entire job is to know the hour should show its work.
#:
#: **What we use.** `zoneinfo.ZoneInfo("Area/City")` is the standard library's
#: IANA timezone support, present since Python 3.9. This repository requires
#: 3.10, so it is always there and costs nothing to depend on. The schedule may
#: name a zone; when it does, that is authoritative, and it is the right place
#: for it because the human's timezone is a fact about the human and belongs
#: in the human's file.
#:
#: **What we fall back to.** With no zone named, `datetime.now()` returns the
#: naive local time of whatever process is running -- correct on a workstation,
#: and *silently wrong* anywhere the environment says UTC, which is most
#: containers and every CI runner. That is a second, independent reason this
#: file must never run in CI: it would not merely be useless there, it would be
#: confidently incorrect. Naming a zone removes the ambiguity entirely, which is
#: why the schedule offers the field.
#:
#: **Where the zone data comes from.** `zoneinfo` reads the operating system's
#: IANA database on Linux and macOS. Windows ships none, and the documented
#: remedy is the `tzdata` package from PyPI. **We do not add it.** A dependency
#: that exists to serve one optional field of one child project's advisory tool
#: is a bad trade in a repository that pins and audits what it fetches, so a
#: missing database degrades to system local time with the reason said out loud
#: rather than raising.
#:
#: **What we deliberately did not reach for.**
#:
#: - `pytz` -- superseded by `zoneinfo` for exactly this, and its `localize()`
#:   convention is a long-standing source of off-by-an-hour bugs. There is no
#:   reason to take on a dependency to get a worse interface.
#: - `arrow`, `pendulum`, `dateutil` -- convenience layers over what the two
#:   calls below already do. Nothing here needs parsing, arithmetic across
#:   zones, or humanised deltas.
#: - `datetime.utcnow()` -- deprecated since 3.12, and it returns a *naive*
#:   value that looks like local time and is not. It is named here so that
#:   nobody reintroduces it as a tidy-up.
#: - **Network time.** No NTP, no HTTP date header. It would make an offline,
#:   instant, unfailing check into a slow one that can fail, in exchange for
#:   accuracy nobody needs: being wrong by a second does not matter here, and
#:   being wrong by an hour is a timezone question rather than a clock one.
#:
#: **Daylight saving is handled by not handling it.** The window is wall-clock
#: local time, because "I work eight to six" is a claim about what a clock on a
#: wall says. Expressed that way it stays true across a DST change for free;
#: expressed in UTC it would drift by an hour twice a year and be wrong in the
#: direction of working longer.
#:
#: **And the honest limit: this measures a window, not work.** It knows what
#: hour it is and what hours were declared. It does not know whether the human
#: worked ten hours or twenty minutes inside them, or anything at all about
#: yesterday. **The ten-hour ceiling is therefore a bound on availability and
#: not on effort**, and the policy is casual on purpose because the measurement
#: to make it strict does not exist yet. Tracking usage would mean recording
#: what somebody did and when, which is a surveillance question this project
#: has not asked and should not answer by accident.

HERE = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
SCHEDULE = os.path.join(HERE, "schedule.json")

#: The ceiling, in hours, on a working window. **Not configurable, and that is
#: the point of it.** The human sets the window; this file sets the most the
#: window may be. A limit somebody can raise from inside the session it limits
#: is not a limit, it is a suggestion with extra steps.
#:
#: **Ten is provisional and is expected to be refined.** It was chosen by the
#: maintainer rather than derived from anything, which is recorded as an open
#: shortcoming in the ecosystem's general ethics register rather than left
#: implied -- this project's README links it. A
#: schedule that exceeds it is **refused outright** -- not clamped to it, not
#: warned about and honoured. Clamping would silently answer a question the
#: human asked, and this file does not have the standing to do that.
MAX_HOURS = 10

#: The window used when there is no schedule on disk. It is *at* the ceiling
#: rather than under it, which is worth noticing rather than smoothing over:
#: it means the recommended state is also the most work this tool will condone.
#: Argued, not settled, in the general ethics register this project links to.
DEFAULT = {"from": "08:00", "to": "18:00"}

#: Breaks are windows *inside* the working window, declared the same way and
#: read the same way. There are none by default: a break somebody did not ask
#: for is an interruption, and this file is not in the business of those.
