# martyria

**Eunoia listing:** unadvertised

**Handoff, 2026-09-15:** this project moved from anoieu to kanon in `7eb9973`.
Earlier observations below retain their original context and dates.

A **child project** under [`docs/policy.md`](../../docs/policy.md). Started by a
human, read-only, unadvertised, and not part of what this repository ships.
Deleting this directory changes nothing anywhere else.

## The name

*μαρτυρία — testimony; the evidence a witness gives.* The word names what this
project deals in. It does not reason about what is good; it takes a situation
that is actually in front of us, assembles what can be **shown** about it, and
reaches a stance somebody can act on. A claim about one's own conduct is worth
very little; an artifact somebody else can check is worth something, and
gathering those is most of the work.

**The project and one entry in its register share the word, deliberately.** A
single dated, contradictable piece of evidence about conduct *is* a martyria,
and this directory is the engine that collects them and deliberates from them.
That is a part-and-whole relationship rather than an ambiguity, and it is said
here because a previous name for this family was ambiguous in exactly the way
that matters.

## The question

**What should we do about this particular situation, and what can be shown about
how we behaved in it?** One situation per entry, each ending in a stance
somebody can act on or an explicit deferral saying what would settle it.

## Its sibling, and the line between them

[`../zetesis/`](../zetesis/README.md) is the **general** inquiry: what standard
this ecosystem is held to, taken from work done outside rather than derived
here, and the structural gaps that stop our claims being checkable at all. It
asks questions that would still be interesting if no situation had ever arisen,
and it decides nothing.

**This project is the other half and only the other half.** It is the actionable
one. It derives no general principles — where an entry needs one it **takes it
from zetesis and cites it**, or records that none exists, which is a finding for
zetesis rather than a gap to paper over here.

The two-way test. A question that stops mattering the moment somebody decides
belongs here. A question that would still matter if nobody ever decided belongs
next door.

## What it keeps

| file | what it is |
| --- | --- |
| [`stances.md`](stances.md) | one live situation per entry, each ending in something somebody can act on |
| [`witnessed.md`](witnessed.md) | the evidence a stance rests on: testimony declared, cases read out of artifacts, and counter-cases — the occasions a cost was available and not paid |
| [`case-cvc5-12891.md`](case-cvc5-12891.md) | a self-assessment of our own conduct as the party making a request of somebody else's project |

## Standing permission to observe

**Granted by the maintainer, 2026-09-02: this project may examine what we are
doing, silently and without announcing it.** No session has to be told it is
being read, and nothing here asks permission per occasion.

**What that permits.** Reading any tree, any history, any correspondence in this
ecosystem, and recording what it finds in the registers here under the rules
those pages already state — evidence with coordinates, costs named, and the
overclaim each entry invites written down beside it.

**What it does not permit, and the grant is worth less without these.** It does
not permit *acting*: nothing is sent, replied to, published or filed as a
consequence of observing, and a person carries anything that leaves. It does not
permit **judging people** — the unit is the artifact, and a register of conduct
is one careless step from a performance review of whoever appears in the log.
And it does not permit an entry that flatters without one that does not: the
counter-case rule holds for anything found this way, and silent observation that
only ever produced good news would be the clearest possible sign the grant was
being misused.

**Why silence rather than notice.** Observation announced in advance changes
what it observes, and the conduct worth recording is the conduct nobody was
performing. The cost is that the observed party cannot object at the time, which
is why the grant is written down here, in public, rather than held informally —
**being silent per occasion and loud about the arrangement** is the only version
of this that stays defensible.

## What this project does not do

- **General ethics research.** That is zetesis's, and it is out of scope here
  even where an entry would benefit from it.
- **Acting.** Nothing here sends a message, replies to anybody, opens or closes
  anything, or commits this ecosystem to a course outward. A stance is what we
  would do and what we would say if asked; a person does the doing.
- **Deciding for anybody else.** A stance about another project's tree is a
  statement about *our* conduct toward it, never a recommendation to them.
- **Certifying.** No badge, no score, no verdict on anybody, including us. A
  register of one's own good conduct is the easiest self-serving document there
  is, and [`witnessed.md`](witnessed.md) carries the rules that keep it from
  becoming one.
- **Speaking for anoieu in public.** Its output is internal until a person
  carries it.

## The one mechanism it maintains

**The sleep protocol**, [`PROTO-18`](../../docs/interface.md), and the schedule
behind it. That makes this the only ethics project here that ships a program
rather than a page, and it is worth saying why the program landed in the
*actionable* half rather than the general one: the question *should an agent
tell a person to stop working* belongs to [zetesis](../zetesis/README.md) and is
open there. **What belongs here is that a specific person is working specific
hours and something should say so.** One situation, one artifact, acted on.

| file | what it is |
| --- | --- |
| [`sleep.py`](sleep.py) | reads the clock and the schedule; prints one sentence and an exit code. Never run in CI |
| [`schedule.json`](schedule.json) | the human's window, their breaks, and the date it was set |

**The ceiling of ten hours a day is in the code and not in the file.** A limit
the human can raise from inside the session it is limiting is not a limit, and
putting it where changing it is a commit rather than an edit is the whole of the
enforcement — which is to say there is almost none, deliberately. The tool can
be ignored, the file can be rewritten, and neither is a defect. **What it buys
is that moving the line leaves a mark.** The human-facing half is
[`INST-1`](../../docs/maintenance.md).

### It is not an island, and this is the statement saying so

**A child project is normally an island: nothing outside it names it, and
deleting the directory changes nothing anywhere else. A child that breaks that
has to say so in its charter, and this paragraph is martyria doing it.** It is
named by
`scripts/ecosystem/ecosystem.py`, which reads the schedule so the ecosystem's health
summary can show where the human stands. The exception is recorded here rather
than avoided, because the dependency is real and hiding it would make the
charter false rather than make the project an island.

**The reference is soft.** `ecosystem.py` asks for the mechanism and carries on
without it, so deleting this directory still changes nothing that matters —
the health summary loses one row and reports it as unknown. That keeps the
practical half of the island rule while admitting the formal break.

**And it is a sign this should graduate.** A mechanism the whole ecosystem is
supposed to honour does not belong in a read-only child project, for the same
reason `tools/stathmos` says it belongs elsewhere: a thing others depend on
should live somewhere they may depend on it. **What stays here in either case
is the argument** — the stance, the ceiling, and the reasoning for both. What
moves is the program.

## Status

**Started 2026-09-02**, by the maintainer, at their explicit instruction — the
only way one of these may begin. Two stances — `S1`, how to respond to an
unsolicited pull request that arrived at the project this ecosystem serves; and
`S3`, the working window — plus one mechanism, the sleep protocol, which is the
first thing this project maintains rather than merely records. Three
testimonies, three cases and one counter-case stand behind `S1`.
