# The names

A register of names the ecosystem has reserved, what each was reserved *for*,
and whether anybody has taken it. Kept here because naming a tool that does not
exist is what this project spends most of its time doing, and because a brand
new repository needs one page rather than an argument.

**Nothing here is an assignment.** A reserved name is a description somebody
wrote down, not work anybody promised. Taking one commits you to the shape of
the description or to changing it, and either is fine — what is not fine is
taking a name whose description you have not read.

## The convention

Greek, and preferably from the vocabulary the ecosystem already draws on. The
name should **describe the work** rather than decorate it, and the repository's
own README explains the etymology in a sentence somebody can disagree with. Two
tests, both cheap: a name that needs no explanation is not following the
convention, and a name whose explanation is strained means the scope has not
been decided yet.

Descriptive non-Greek names are allowed where the thing is a program rather than
an account — `anoieu_fuzz` is one — but the burden is on the name to earn it.

**And the convention has a second reason, found by breaking it.** A child
project named with an ordinary English word makes every sentence using that word
ambiguous — proper noun, or common one — and the ambiguity is not only a reading
cost. anoieu's `scripts/policy_check.py` decides whether a child project is an
island by grepping the tree for **the bare project name**, so a common word matches prose
about the *subject* rather than about the project, and reports an island break
that is not one. An unusual name reads unambiguously and greps unambiguously,
and those turn out to be the same property. The case is written up in
[martyria’s charter](https://github.com/ajreynol/epikrisis/blob/main/tools/martyria/README.md), which was named `ethics` for
about an hour.

## Taken

| name | what it is |
| --- | --- |
| **eunoia** | the language itself — εὔνοια, *good thinking* |
| **ethos** | the proof checker |
| **logos** | the **L**ean development — the initial is load-bearing, and is what makes `iogos` below a joke |
| **eudaimonia** | the calculus template |
| **anoieu** | the analyzer; *eunoia* read backwards |
| **dokimasia** | δοκιμασία, the scrutiny before office: what no proof step covers |
| **sapheneia** | σαφήνεια, clarity of an account: Eunoia as a language definition. A child project, in kanon |
| **ynoia** | *why Eunoia*: whether the arrangement earns its machinery. A child project, in kanon |
| **euthyna** | εὔθυνα, the audit at end of term: what logos's proof is made of. **Started**, in eudaimonia |
| **stathmos** | σταθμός, a standard weight — the thing an object is weighed against, not the scale and not the verdict: what each tool weighs against the ecosystem's tenets, and the evidence for it. Holds `R30`, and is intended to move to a repository of its own. **Started**, in kanon |
| **tekmerion** | τεκμήριον, conclusive evidence as against a mere sign: the evidence that what these documents say is still true, claim by claim. The name is the standard it is held to rather than a description of what it has. **Started**, in anoieu |
| **martyria** | μαρτυρία, testimony — the evidence a witness gives: the **actionable** ethics project. One situation at a time, the evidence it rests on, and a stance somebody can act on. Also the name of one entry in its register. **Started; now in epikrisis** |
| **zetesis** | ζήτησις, inquiry — the seeking, as against the having-found: the **general** half. What standard this ecosystem is held to, taken from work done outside, and whether our record could show we met it. It has no standard yet, which is why the name is the one it is. **Started; now in epikrisis** |
| **kanon** | κανών, the measuring rod — the standard a thing is held straight against: the ecosystem's governance, out of the analyzer — the policy, vision, inventory and joining scripts, in a repository that is not also the tool that files findings against members. The checker stays in anoieu. Argued as `B15` on the board and `P2` in [`proposals.md`](proposals.md). **Its own repository**, joined 2026-09-14; governance arrived 2026-09-15 |
| **koine** | κοινή, *the common tongue* — the shared dialect that let people who spoke differently understand each other. The shared machinery of the reporting loop, so the protocol has one implementation rather than one per member. **Its own repository**, and a member; audited as [`P1`](proposals.md) |
| **noesis** | νόησις, *the act of understanding* — the semantics and the compiler defined **in** Lean rather than compiled into it: a verified Eunoia compiler. **Started**, in eudaimonia, and found there rather than declared here — see the note under *Reserved* |
| **hermeneia** | ἑρμηνεία, interpretation — correspondence between embedded SMT-LIB semantics and Lean's native logic. **Started**, in eudaimonia at `tools/hermeneia` |
| **mimesis** | μίμησις, imitation — learning to express a calculus through worked examples: how a Eunoia signature is written and how one gets into Logos, in two strands, case studies and tutorials. **Started**, in eudaimonia at `tools/mimesis` |
| **workflow-launcher** | descriptive rather than Greek, and the register's own exception applies: it is a program and not an account. The first hour of a new tool's life, and a register of what this ecosystem's practice turns out to be doing. A child project, in eudaimonia |

**Names chosen outside this ecosystem are not here.** `cvc5` and `ethos-eoc` are
in [`ecosystem.json`](../../scripts/ecosystem/ecosystem.json) and will never be in this table: it
registers names *we* reserved, and theirs were settled by other people before any
of this existed. An entry in the inventory with no row here is a gap only when
the name was ours to choose.

## Reserved for an intended launch

An intention recorded by the maintainer, not a launched project. No location
is assigned until the launch.

There is currently nothing reserved for an intended launch. `mimesis` was the
last, reserved on 2026-09-16 and started the same day.

## Reserved, and free to take

Each was named in [`why-eunoia.md`](why-eunoia.md) because some argument there is
stated relative to its absence. **None of the names below has a repository, and
none has a line of code** — a claim this table has now been wrong about once.
**None of them currently has a stub** either: a placeholder directory carrying
one sentence and doing nothing. **A stub is not a claim on the name.** It marks
a place, and it is deleted under the handoff protocol in
[`protocols.md`](../../docs/protocols.md). `noesis` sat here while eudaimonia
was already running it as a child project, and it moved to *Taken* only because
somebody went looking in the neighbouring tree. **Being in this table is not
evidence that a name is unused**, for the same reason the section after it
exists.

| name | Greek | what it would be |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **nomophylax** | νομοφύλαξ, guardian of the laws — the office that held the statutes and checked that magistrates acted within them | **the tool that maintains `docs/laws.md`**, and checks a closed stretch entry against the rules it was supposed to be written under. Not a lawgiver: amendments stay a person's. Suggested 2026-09-02. It completes a family already here by accident — `dokimasia` scrutinises **before** office, `euthyna` audits **after**, this watches **during**. `thesmos` was the alternative |
| **euboulia** | εὐβουλία, good counsel — the quality of deliberating well, as against the deliberating itself. It shares its prefix with *eunoia* by construction | **the ethical advisor to whoever holds the laws.** The ecosystem's ethics gathered into one place, advising `nomophylax` and deciding nothing. Would accumulate `martyria` and `zetesis`, which moved through kanon on 2026-09-15 and are now child projects of epikrisis (2026-09-17). Suggested 2026-09-02. `bouleusis` stays free and stays the better name for anything that decides cases |
| **pathos** | πάθος, the third mode of persuasion | an efficient *verified* proof checker — the one that would let the ecosystem ship what it proves rather than a second implementation |
| **iogos** | not Greek: `logos` with the **L** of Lean swapped for the **I** of Isabelle. The one joke in the register, and it earns its place by fixing the scope in the name | the same calculus, semantics and soundness development redone against Isabelle/HOL — an Isabelle backend for `ethos-eoc`, and logos rebuilt on it, as an independence check |
| **elenchos** | ἔλεγχος, cross-examination | differential fuzzing derived from the calculus rather than written by hand — what the fuzzer here is a deliberate baseline for |

## In use elsewhere, and claimed by nobody

Names a tree in this ecosystem is actually using, which no one has entered in
the tables above. **They are not free.** The section exists because this
register once reported a name as free when a neighbouring tree was already
using it, and a name was taken on the strength of that.

| name | where | why it is not in the tables above |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **epikrisis** | **a repository of its own**, promoted out of eudaimonia | it audits how repositories change over time, and it is running. It stays here rather than moving to *Taken* because that table records names **we** reserved, and this one was chosen in somebody else's tree. **Promotion changed where it lives and not who named it** |
| **eschaton** | **a repository of its own**, [ajreynol/eschaton](https://github.com/ajreynol/eschaton) | compares approaches to better-founded SMT solvers and their costs. Its name was chosen in its own tree, not reserved here |
| **tachyon** | **a repository of its own**, [ajreynol/tachyon](https://github.com/ajreynol/tachyon), and an ecosystem member | searches for ways to improve cvc5 performance through reproducible experiments. Its name was chosen in its own tree, not reserved here |
| **telos** | a child project at `tools/telos` in eschaton, moved out of dokimasia | research toward a proof-first SMT solver whose output is checked by Logos. Its name was chosen in its original parent's tree; moving it changes its location, not who named it |
| **apodeixis** | a child project in eudaimonia — the build framework driven at a calculus nobody designed it around | its authors deliberately did not claim it here, on the ground that adding a line to somebody else's register is a person's edit to make. That restraint is the reason it looked free |

**`bouleusis`** — βούλευσις, deliberation about particulars — was considered
for the actionable half and not used, since `martyria` covers it. Free, and the
argument for it is in anoieu's history, where this project began.

**So the register is not the whole answer to *is this name free*.** It records
what has been claimed, and a name can be in use without being claimed. Look in
the trees as well, which costs one grep.

## If none of them fits

Then the work is new, which is the interesting case. Pick a word for **what the
tool does to its subject** rather than for the subject — the register above is
mostly verbs of examination, because that is mostly what these tools do — and
write the etymology down before writing any code. If the sentence explaining the
name is hard to write, the scope is what is unclear, not the vocabulary.

Add the name here when you take it, with one line, and say where it lives.
**Where it lives is part of the entry rather than decoration.** A name that
starts as a child project and later graduates into a repository of its own keeps
its entry and changes that clause, and that is the only edit graduating asks of
this page. `init_eo from-child` reads the entry and is told to report the change
as owed rather than to make it — this file is in somebody else's tree, and a
new repository does not edit it.
