# ynoia

*The name is **"why Eunoia"**, elided. It keeps the root and drops the
judgement: εὔνοια is εὖ + νοῦς, **good thinking** — and this project removes the
εὖ and asks whether the thinking is good. That is a claim somebody can disagree
with: if the arrangement is obviously right and the question idle, the name is
wrong and so is the project. It also follows the sibling convention — [anoieu](../../README.md) is
Eunoia read backwards, and this is Eunoia read as a question.*

A child project under [`docs/policy.md`](../../docs/policy.md). Started by a
human, read-only, unadvertised, and not part of what this repository ships.
Deleting this directory changes nothing anywhere else.

## The question

**Does the Eunoia ecosystem's arrangement earn its machinery — and what is it
missing?**

An SMT solver has found an answer and is asked to justify it. It can emit a Lean
proof and have Lean check it, or it can emit a proof in a fixed calculus written
in a small language, have a checker check that, and *also* compile the calculus
into a Lean development that says its rules are sound. The ecosystem chose the
second. It is more machinery, and the case for it has been made in conversation
and never written down where somebody could attack it.

So: write it down, make the strongest case against it, and see which survives.

## Goals, in order

1. **The argument, both directions.** The case for the calculus, the case for
   doing it in Lean instead, the general objections to each, and six coherent
   ways the ecosystem could be arranged — stated so that somebody who disagrees
   has something to disagree *with*. [`why-eunoia.md`](why-eunoia.md).

2. **The tools that do not exist.** Every argument above is stated relative to
   what exists today, so the cheapest way to see which arguments are about the
   *arrangement* and which are merely about its *current state* is to name the
   work that would move each one. Some of those names have since been taken up
   as real projects, which is the closest thing this project has to a result.
   The register of the ones that have not, in priority order, is
   [`tools.md`](tools.md); the arguments stay in the account.

3. **The names.** Naming work that does not exist is most of what goal 2
   produces, so the register lives on its own page: what each reserved name was
   reserved *for*, which are taken, and how to choose one that is not there.
   [`names.md`](names.md). It is the page a brand new repository is pointed at,
   and it is deliberately short — a repository choosing its name should not have
   to read an argument about the ecosystem first.

4. **Auditing proposals.** Whether a given idea deserves a repository of its
   own is the account's general question applied to one case, with a decision
   attached — so it is answered here, against a stated standard, in
   [`proposals.md`](proposals.md). Most wants are not that question, and the
   ones that are work rather than repositories are tracked in
   [`requests.md`](requests.md) with an argument about whose tree they belong
   in. The output is an argument with a
   recommendation at the end. **It approves nothing:** a repository is a claim
   on a shared namespace and on years of somebody's attention, and the policy
   reserves that for a person. anoieu carries proposals in, because it is the
   only tool that may address a child project directly.

5. **Which projects have a paper in them.** The ecosystem's policy asks a
   repository with a result to write it up for a human, in `report/`, and its
   vision argues why. Neither says which repositories have one, because that is
   a judgement — so it is made here, against a stated standard, one entry per
   tool, in [`papers.md`](papers.md). The commonest verdict is **no**, this
   project returns it about itself first, and a repository's own stance on
   publishing outranks anything on the page.

6. **Wishue: what would settle it.** An argument that cannot be lost is not
   worth having. The account carries what would change our minds and one
   experiment that would settle more than any further argument. Turning that into
   something somebody could actually run is the wishue, and it remains one.

## What this project does not do

The boundary matters more than the goals, so it is stated first.

- **It does not decide anything.** Nobody here has the authority to rearrange an
  ecosystem, and an account that reads as a decision has overstepped. The
  arrangements it describes are options laid out fairly, not a recommendation
  with the alternatives listed for form's sake.
- **It does not report defects.** Where reading the ecosystem turned up something
  actually wrong in somebody's file, that is a finding: it leaves through
  [`reporting-workflow.md`](../../docs/reports/reporting-workflow.md) with an id and a
  state, and never through here. This project's output is argument.
- **It does not speak for anoieu.** The host tool is a participant in the
  argument and an interested one — it exists because the narrow-fragment position
  is right — and the account says so rather than pretending to neutrality it
  does not have.
- **It does not commit anybody to the tools it names.** A named project with a
  paragraph attached is a description of work that would change an argument, not
  a roadmap, not an assignment, and not a claim that anybody intends to build it.
- **It does not describe the language.** What Eunoia *is*, independently of any
  checker, is a different question with a different child project.

## Status

**Now also the place it is argued which projects are worth a paper**, which is
the second thing this project has been asked to produce for somebody else. It is
the same judgement the account makes about work that does not exist, pointed at
work that does, and it is the page most likely to be wrong in a way somebody
notices — which is an improvement on being unread.

**Also the place proposals are audited**, which is the first thing this
project has been asked to produce for somebody else rather than for itself. Its
first audit, `P1`, was carried to a decision and a repository was approved on the
strength of it — which is a deliverable in the sense the vision means, and would
be the thing that earns this project a place there. Whether it has is not this
project's call.

**The account exists and is long.** Nothing in it has been argued with by
anybody who disagrees, which is the whole point of writing it and has not
happened yet. It has produced no deliverable and so has earned no place in
[`docs/vision.md`](../../docs/vision.md) — with one qualification: of the six projects it named, **euthyna** has since been started
as a child project of eudaimonia, and the register in
[`names.md`](names.md) is now consulted by `prompts/init_eo` when a new
repository picks a name. Whether that is this account's doing or
convergence is not something this project can establish about itself.

## Is there a paper in this?

**No, and this project says so about itself first** so that the verdicts it
returns about other people's work read as judgements rather than as modesty spent
on others.

This project's output is **argument**, and it has taken no measurement. A paper
assembled from it would be a position piece about how to arrange an ecosystem,
written by the ecosystem, with nothing in it a reader could check. The account is
worth reading and worth disagreeing with; neither of those makes it a result.

Stated because [`../../docs/policy.md`](../../docs/policy.md) asks every child
project to say whether a paper exists for it, what the plan is, or that there is
nothing in it worth writing up. This is the third answer, and it is the
commonest. [`papers.md`](papers.md) is where the same question is asked of every
other tool.
