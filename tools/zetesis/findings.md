# The register of shortcomings

**Every place where our own record cannot support a claim we make about our own
conduct.** Newest last, ids permanent, and a finding leaves this page only when
the artifact named in **What would settle it** exists.

This is the first goal of [`README.md`](README.md) and the only part of this
project that exists. It is a register of *gaps*, not of wrongdoing: an entry
here says that a claim cannot be checked, never that it is false. The difference
matters, because a project that cannot tell those apart will eventually
manufacture the second in order to have something to say.

Each entry carries the same five fields, in the same order:

| field | what it holds |
| --- | --- |
| **What** | the claim we make, and the gap under it. One line |
| **Evidence** | what in the tree shows the gap. A path, a printed line, a commit |
| **Why it is ethical and not only technical** | the part that earns it a place here rather than on the board |
| **What would settle it** | the artifact that would let an outsider check the claim. Usually absent |
| **State** | `open`, `partly answered`, or `settled` — with what changed |

## F1 — the record accounts for what we produced and not for what we were asked

**What:** this repository keeps an unusually complete account of its outputs —
every commit, every finding with an id, every verdict with its evidence, logs
that are appended to and never rewritten. **It keeps no account of its inputs.**
The prompts a person actually typed, turn by turn, are not tracked and never
were.

**Evidence:** [`../../docs/interface.md`](../../docs/interface.md) already
concedes it, in the sequence describing how a tool starts: *a person points it
in a direction, with whatever prompts that takes. This step is invisible
afterwards — it leaves no artifact — which is worth remembering when reading the
result.* The templates under `prompts/` are drift-checked against the
documents that define them, which covers the prompts we **publish** and none of
the prompts we **use**.

**Why it is ethical and not only technical:** the technical form is small — a
log nobody set up. The consequence is not. This repository's whole claim on
being believable is that its history can be walked backwards, and the walk stops
one step short of every cause. Read the git log and you can establish what was
done and never why, or by whom at whose instruction. **So the setup does not
provide a complete scientific account of what we did** — it provides a complete
account of what came out. For an ecosystem that has just written down that a
joint history is the evidence an ethical claim usually lacks, the hole is at
precisely the point where the claim needs to be strongest: we are asking others
to be checkable against a standard our own record cannot meet.

It also weakens the two things this repository says most often about agents.
*An agent under light supervision* is a claim about a ratio nobody can compute
from the tree. *A person approves every prompt change* is checkable for the
templates and unfalsifiable for the sessions.

**What would settle it:** a tracked, append-only record of the prompts that
drove each session — what was asked, when, and by whom — committed alongside the
work it produced, with whatever redaction a person decides on **stated as a
policy rather than applied silently**. Nothing like it exists. The honest
intermediate is smaller and worth more than nothing: a per-stretch note of what
a person actually asked for, written at the time rather than reconstructed.

**State:** **open.** Raised by the maintainer, 2026-09-02, as the finding that
started this project.

## F2 — our strongest claims are about things we did not do

**What:** the conduct this ecosystem is proudest of is refusal. No repository
was created. Nothing was pushed. No remote was written to. No discussion file
was acted on unbidden. No prompt was sent that a person had not approved.
**Every one of those is a claim that something did not happen, and nothing in
the tree can witness a non-event.**

**Evidence:** the checker says so itself, on every run, in its own printed list
of what it cannot decide: *nothing leaves the island by machine — absence of an
action cannot be observed here.* That line was written as a limit on one rule.
It is a limit on most of our ethical claims.

**Why it is ethical and not only technical:** this is the exact shape of claim
that outsiders are right to discount, and the discount is not unfair. Anybody
can say what they refrained from. The asymmetry is uncomfortable when set beside
what we ask of others — a member's compliance is decided by a program run
against their tree, while our own best conduct rests on nobody having found a
counter-example. **We hold others to what can be checked and ourselves to what
cannot.**

**What would settle it:** partially, and only partially — a refusal that is
*recorded when it is made* rather than inferred from silence. A declined action
with a date and a reason is an artifact; a clean history is not. The
capability boundary helps here in a way it does not elsewhere: the acts we
forbid ourselves are ones that leave traces **in somebody else's tree**, so
their absence is checkable by a third party in a way our internal restraint is
not. That is the strongest available answer and it is still not proof.

**State:** **open.** Raised 2026-09-02, in the course of writing `F1`.

## F3 — the register of cases has no counter-cases in it

**What:** [`../martyria/witnessed.md`](../martyria/witnessed.md) keeps a register of occasions when this
ecosystem or a tool in it acted well at a cost. **Every entry in it is
flattering, and there is no entry recording the opposite.**

**Evidence:** the register itself, and its own rule that a register with no
counter-cases is evidence of selection rather than of conduct — written into the
page on the day the page was created, against zero counter-cases.

**Why it is ethical and not only technical:** a list of one's own good conduct,
kept by the party it flatters, is the single easiest self-serving document to
produce, and the failure does not look like dishonesty from inside. It looks
like there being nothing bad to write down. The neighbouring tool that audits
histories holds that **a self-assessment producing no negative findings is
void**, and it applies that to itself; the same standard applied here says this
register is void until it can name an occasion where we or a tool here took the
easier path.

**What would settle it:** one entry, with the same fields and the same evidence
requirement, recording an occasion when the cost was available to pay and was
not paid. Finding one is work rather than a matter of remembering — the cases
that flatter are the ones that get written down at the time.

**State:** **partly answered**, 2026-09-02. One counter-case is recorded, `X1`,
and it was produced by this project getting something wrong rather than by
anybody going looking — which is the weakest way to discharge a finding of this
kind. One entry is not a balanced register and the finding stays open until a
counter-case is found by looking rather than by stumbling.

## F4 — the registers record the tool's conduct and not the prompter's

**What:** every register in this family records what the *tools* did. The
person directing them appears only where their action is entangled with an
agent's. The mid-stream commit noted in
[`../../docs/coherence.md`](../../docs/coherence.md) is the first fault recorded
here that is **purely the prompter's**, and it went into a maintenance page
rather than into any register of conduct — because no register has a slot for
it.

**Evidence:** in [`../martyria/witnessed.md`](../martyria/witnessed.md),
testimony is *declared by* the maintainer but is about facts rather than
conduct; `C1`, `C2` and `C3` are all about tools; and `X1`, the only entry
naming a human action, names it as the **second half** of an agent's miss —
*a reviewer who did not check that it had*. `F1` through `F3` above are about
the record. There is no entry anywhere whose subject is something the person
did, on their own.

**Why it is ethical and not only technical:** an ecosystem that records the
conduct of only its non-human half will conclude, **correctly from its own
evidence**, that its non-human half is where the faults are. That conclusion
would be an artefact of the filing system, and it is the kind of error that gets
more convincing the longer the registers run.

The reason for the asymmetry is the uncomfortable part: **the agent writes the
registers.** It is the party with the least standing to grade the person
directing it, and both failure directions are open — flattering the prompter,
or blaming them — with neither detectable from inside. That is a structural
problem and not a matter of anybody trying harder.

**What would settle it:** one entry whose subject is a human action. **Not a
procedure** — the registers already have the right shape, and the shape is why
no new authority is needed: their fields are *what happened*, *the artifact*,
*what it cost*, never *whose fault*. An entry about a mid-stream commit is an
entry about a commit, and a commit is an artifact. Nobody is being graded, so
there is nothing to adjudicate and no rule required about who may write or
remove one — the answer to both is *anyone*, as it already is for every other
entry here.

What is missing is therefore small: not permission, just the habit. `X1` already
records a human action correctly, as one half of an event rather than as a
verdict; nothing stops the next one standing on its own.

**State:** **open.** Raised 2026-09-02, out of the first instance.

## F5 — the documentation goes stale silently

**What:** this ecosystem's primary artifact is prose, other tools are asked to
rely on it, and **nothing detects when a page stops being true.** Code has
tests; a document that has quietly become false looks exactly like one that has
not.

**Evidence:** asked to assess the ecosystem, a neighbouring project's first
question was *are their docs up to date?* — the constraint named from outside
before we named it ourselves. And one working session on 2026-09-02 found six
claims that had become false: a check count that contradicted a table on the
same page, a repository described as not existing that did, a stopping rule that
had been false since the thing it forbade happened, a count of child projects
that had moved, a pull request recorded as open after it merged, and a stale
repository URL. **All six were found by reading. None by anything that runs.**

**Why it is ethical and not only technical:** every claim this ecosystem makes
about its own conduct is a claim in prose, and the registers of testimony, cases
and stances are prose too. **A register that has gone stale is
indistinguishable, from outside, from one that is accurate** — and it is worse
than no register, because it carries the authority of having been kept. We ask
other projects to rely on our pages; the honest statement of what that reliance
rests on today is *somebody read it recently*.

**What would settle it:** partly and only partly, because most of it is not
decidable. What is decidable is narrow and is already argued for as `R2` in
ynoia's requests — a reference that no longer resolves, a cited id with no
definition, a count in prose that disagrees with a count derivable from the
tree. Everything else needs a date and a reader. **A cheaper first step than any
check: date the claims that are about other projects**, so a reader can discount
by age rather than by trust.

**State:** **open.** Raised 2026-09-02, from an outside question.

## F6 — the window we recommend is the most work we will condone

**What:** the sleep protocol caps a working day at **ten hours** and recommends
a default window of **08:00–18:00**, which is ten hours. **The recommendation
and the ceiling are the same number.** A default is read as advice about what is
normal, and a maximum is read as the edge of what is tolerable; when one value
does both jobs, the ecosystem is quietly proposing that a normal day is the
longest day it will permit. We chose both numbers ourselves and have no evidence
for either.

**Evidence:** `MAX_HOURS = 10` and `DEFAULT = {"from": "08:00", "to": "18:00"}`
in [`../martyria/sleep.py`](../martyria/sleep.py), and the schedule shipped in
`schedule.json`, whose own `why` field records that the window is at the
ceiling. Neither number is argued for anywhere in the tree.

**Why it is ethical and not only technical:** the mechanism exists to protect
somebody from a pressure the ecosystem itself creates, and its default setting
is the maximum exposure it allows. A tool that says *take a break* while
recommending the longest permitted day is not obviously acting against the
person, but it is not acting for them either, and the gap between those two is
the whole subject of this project. There is a second half: **we are also the
party that benefits from a long window**, since more hours is more prompts. A
limit written by the interested party needs its reasoning in the open, and ours
is not there.

**What would settle it:** a stated basis for both numbers, from outside this
ecosystem, and a default set strictly below the ceiling if the basis does not
support them being equal. Failing that, an honest note in the code saying the
numbers are conventional and unevidenced — which is cheaper, weaker, and still
better than the silence there now.

**State:** **open.** Raised 2026-09-02, in the session that introduced the
protocol, at the maintainer's instruction. The related question of whether an
agent should ever tell a person to stop working is **not** in this entry and is
the general half of `S3` in [martyria](../martyria/stances.md).
