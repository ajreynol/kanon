# Feedback to the ethos user manual

Candidate feedback found by writing [`manual.md`](manual.md) — a second account
of the same language — and noticing where the second reading could not recover
something from the first: a silence, an ambiguity, or a place the document does
not appear to agree with itself. Some rows below are checkable by reading the
sentence they cite; others are judgement, and those are the ones most likely to
be a defect in our reading rather than in the manual.

**Nothing here has been carried anywhere.** This is a ledger, not a report. Under
[`docs/policy.md`](../../docs/policy.md), anything that leaves this directory does
so through the host repository's ordinary reporting discipline
(`docs/reports/reporting-workflow.md`), carried by a person who can answer the follow-up,
and only once confirmed. Rows here are *candidates* in the sense of
`docs/reports/reporting-policy.md`: a candidate is published under our own name with the evidence
they have, and explicitly unjudged.

Everything is about the **manual**, never about the language. Where a row
implies a language decision rather than a wording change, it says so and stops
there — proposing the decision is out of this project's charter.

Read against `user_manual.md` at `ethosEoc3` (`3cf1c03`). Section names are the
manual's own headings.

### EOM-01

**Where.** *Full syntax for Eunoia commands*.

**What.** `<term> ::= <symbol> | (<symbol> <term>+) | (! <term> <attr>+)` has no
alternative for literals, so `5`, `"abc"` and `#b010` are not derivable as
terms. `<sexpr>` has a `<literal>` alternative, and `<literal>` itself is never
defined; the six categories are defined in *Literal types* as prose.

**Why it matters.** The grammar is the only place a second implementation would
look for what to parse, and literals are the one construct the language's own
computational operators are entirely about.

**Suggested.** Add `| <literal>` to `<term>`, and a production for `<literal>`
over the six categories in *Literal types*.

### EOM-02

**Where.** *Full syntax for Eunoia commands*, versus *Parametric datatypes*.

**What.** `<datatype-dec> ::= (<cons-dec>+)` cannot derive
`(par (X) (((node …) (leaf))))`, which is the form the manual's own parametric
datatype example uses.

**Suggested.** Add the `par` alternative.

### EOM-03

**Where.** *Full syntax for Eunoia commands*.

**What.** `(! <term> <attr>+)` — SMT-LIB's annotated term — is a term
alternative in the grammar and appears nowhere else in the document. What
attributes are legal on a term, whether the annotation survives into the term,
and whether two terms differing only in annotation are equal, are all
unanswered.

**Why it matters.** Term identity is syntactic in Eunoia
(`eo::eq`, pattern matching), so whether an annotation is part of a term is a
question with observable consequences.

### EOM-04

**Where.** *Overview of Eunoia's features*: "The builtin `eo::define` binder can
be used for specifying terms that contain common subterms analogously to `let`
binders in other languages."

**What.** This is the only occurrence of `eo::define` in the manual. It is not
in the operator lists, not in the grammar, and has no example.

**Why it matters.** Sharing is the difference between a proof that checks in a
second and one that does not, at the sizes machine-generated proofs reach, so
this is likely to be load-bearing for exactly the audience the manual is for.

### EOM-05

**Where.** *Command line options of ethos* (`--no-parse-let`), and *Example:
Term evaluator*, which uses `let` in a program body.

**What.** `let` is described only by the option that disables it — "do not treat
`let` as a builtin symbol for specifying a macro" — and is used, without
comment, in one example. Its syntax, scoping and relationship to `eo::define`
are not given. The option is documented as applying to proof and reference files
only, yet the example that uses `let` is a program, which would normally live in
a signature.

### EOM-06

**Where.** `<common-command>` in the grammar.

**What.** `(declare-sort <symbol> <numeral>)` is accepted and never described.
Its SMT-LIB reading — an *n*-ary type constructor, equivalently
`(declare-const S (-> Type … Type))` — is presumably intended, but a reader has
to supply it.

### EOM-07

**Where.** *Declaring theory signatures*: "`(declare-datatype <symbol>
<datatype-dec>)` defines a datatype `<symbol>`, along with its associated
constructors, selectors, discriminators and updaters."

**What.** Constructors and selectors are described and are readable back via
`eo::dt_constructors` and `eo::dt_selectors`. Discriminators and updaters are
named here and never again: no naming convention, no types, no operator that
returns them. Signatures in the wild declare tester predicates by hand — the
manual's own datatype-splitting example declares `is` itself — which suggests
the sentence may be describing SMT-LIB rather than Eunoia.

**Suggested.** Either describe them, or drop them from the sentence and say that
a signature declares its own.

### EOM-08

**Where.** *Computational Operators*: "Apart from `eo::ite`, the evaluation of
all operators assume that their arguments are fully reduced."

**What.** Two further exceptions are documented elsewhere in the same section
and not counted here.

- `eo::requires` does not evaluate its third argument unless the check passes,
  and that argument "may be non-ground" when it is returned. It is as
  non-strict as `eo::ite`.
- `eo::is_ok` is strict but *observes* that its argument is stuck rather than
  becoming stuck — which is what the whole `eo::is_*` family is built on, since
  `eo::is_eq` is defined from it.

**Why it matters.** This sentence is the whole statement of the evaluation
order, and it is the first thing a second implementation would encode.

**Suggested.** "Apart from `eo::ite` and the third argument of `eo::requires`,
… . Note that `eo::is_ok` is strict but does not propagate failure: it reports
whether its argument reduced to a value."

### EOM-09

**Where.** *Computational Operators*, definitions paragraph.

**What.** "We say a term is a _value_ if it is ground and has no occurrences of
builtin operators or programs that failed to evaluate" — under which a declared
constant `x` and the term `(f x 5)` are values. The same section then uses
*arithmetic value*, *numeral value*, *bitwise value* and *32-bit numeral value*
to mean literals of a category, which is a different notion; the two are never
related.

**Why it matters.** Every operator's contract is written with one of these
words, and reading the wrong one gives the wrong contract. "`eo::hash` — if
`t1` is a value, this returns a numeral unique to `t1`" is true of `(f x 5)`,
which is not obvious on a first reading.

**Suggested.** Name the narrow notion something else — *literal* — or state
explicitly that *X value* for a category `X` is not an instance of *value*.

### EOM-10

**Where.** *Arithmetic operators*, and the examples following.

**What.** `(eo::add 2.0 2.5) == 4.5` — decimals in, decimal out. But
`(eo::qdiv 7.0 2.0) == 7/2` — decimals in, rational out. And
`(eo::qdiv 12 6) == 3/1` — numerals in, rational out. So some operators preserve
the literal category of their arguments and some do not, and which is which is
recoverable only by reading the example block.

**Suggested.** One sentence stating the rule per operator group, next to the
"no mixed arithmetic" rule which is stated well.

### EOM-11

**Where.** *Chainable*: "A chainable operator applied to a single argument
reduces to the neutral element of the combining operator when that operator has
a nil terminator". Same phrasing under *Pairwise*.

**What.** The behaviour is defined by the combining operator's **nil
terminator**, not by any neutral element. The manual is careful elsewhere —
under *Right/Left associative with nil terminator* — to note that the nil
terminator *ought* to be neutral and need not be, and gives
`:right-assoc-nil 1` for `+` as the counterexample. Using "neutral element" here
makes the behaviour of `(>= x)` undefined for exactly the operators that
paragraph warns about.

**Suggested.** "reduces to the nil terminator of the combining operator".

### EOM-12

**Where.** *Declaring Parameterized Constants*, note: "`(declare-parameterized-const foo ((T Type)) T)`
defines `foo` to be of 'quote arrow' type, `(~> T T)`". Versus *Proofs as
terms*, which types the same construction as `(-> (Quote u) S)`.

**What.** Two notations. Whether `~>` is a distinct type constructor or a
shorthand for `->` with a `Quote`d domain is not said, and `~>` appears nowhere
else.

**Why it matters.** This is the core of the type system: it is what makes
dependent typing, `eo::quote` programs and proof rule arguments one mechanism
rather than three.

### EOM-13

**Where.** *Right/Left associative* ("must have a type of the form"),
*Right/Left associative with nil terminator* ("must", then "typically"),
*Chainable* ("Note that the type for chainable operators is typically"),
*Pairwise* (same), *Binder* ("should accept a variable number of arguments"),
*Parameterized constants with Attributes* ("are required to have type
`(-> T T T)`").

**What.** Six statements of the same kind — a constraint relating a symbol's
type to its attribute — expressed with *must*, *typically*, *should* and *are
required to*, with no visible pattern to which is which. None is enforced at the
declaration: a `:right-assoc-nil` operator over `Bool` with an `Int` nil is
accepted, and so is a `:chainable` operator with a non-variadic combiner.
*(Both checked against a build of `ethosEoc3`; `docs/notes.md` §3.)*

**Why it matters.** A reader cannot tell which of these a conforming checker may
reject and which are advice. It is the largest single ambiguity found while
writing the second account, and it is a language question the manual could
settle by choosing its words.

**Suggested.** Use *must* for constraints a checker may reject, *should* for
advice, consistently, and say once — where the attributes are introduced — which
of them are checked today.

### EOM-14

**Where.** *The :opaque annotation*: "Opaque arguments should always be expected
before other arguments. Otherwise all applications of the given function will be
ill-typed."

**What.** The rule is given as a prediction about what happens rather than as a
constraint on declarations, so it is not clear whether a declaration with a late
opaque argument is illegal, or legal and useless. The sentence immediately
above — "Return types can never be marked `:opaque` or a type error will be
immediately reported" — is stated the other way round, as a rejection, which
makes the contrast look deliberate without saying what it means.

### EOM-15

**Where.** *List operators*, which gives `(eo::nil f T)`; *Parametric Nil
terminators*, which says `eo::nil` "accepts a type argument in addition to the
operator"; *Parameterized constants with Attributes*, which says it "optionally
accepts two arguments"; and the example `(eo::nil bvor) == (eo::nil bvor)`,
which uses the one-argument form.

**What.** Three statements of the operator's arity and one use of a form the
operator list does not list. The intended reading is presumably that the type
argument is optional and that omitting it is stuck whenever the terminator is
non-ground — but the one-argument form should appear in the operator list if it
is legal.
