"""Refuse a bump to a commit anoieu's own CI did not pass.

A member takes on whatever we have changed by moving a pin -- `ANOIEU_REV` in
their `anoieu / policy` workflow -- to a commit of this repository. **That bump
is valid only if this repository's CI is green at exactly that commit**, and this
is the program that decides it. Published so that every member does not write it
separately; nothing obliges anybody to use this one, and the requirement is the
refusal rather than the program.

Three properties, and the first is the one everything else follows from.

**It asks about a commit, never about the tip.** Green-at-a-commit is a fact that
never changes once the run has finished; green-at-HEAD is a fact that changes
without anybody committing. Asking about the tip would make the answer depend on
what we pushed this morning, which is the failure the whole pinning discipline
exists to prevent.

**It fails closed.** Not green, not finished, or not reachable -- all refuse.
That is the opposite of how `scripts/status_eo --check --online` treats an
unreachable remote, and the difference is that adopting a policy commit is *optional and
deferrable*: refusing costs a member nothing but a later attempt, where a
fail-closed check inside a build would turn somebody's tree red for a network
they do not own.

**It must never run in CI.** Not ours, not theirs. It reads a remote over the
network, so a build that called it could go red without anybody committing --
and a build that can change colour on its own cannot be evidence that a commit
was good. It is a command a person or a bump script runs at the moment of
adoption, and nothing else.

    python3 scripts/bump_check.py --rev 59e8e07     # may this commit be adopted?
    python3 scripts/bump_check.py --root PATH       # read the pin from a member's workflow
    python3 scripts/bump_check.py --rev X --dry-run # print what it would ask, ask nothing

Exit codes, which are the interface a bump script consumes:

    0   green at that commit -- adoption may proceed
    1   not green -- refuse
    2   could not be verified -- refuse, and say why
