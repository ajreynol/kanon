"""Are we ready to transfer roles to a project?

**One question, and it is deliberately not the whole question.** Readiness here
means *our side is in order and there is somewhere for the roles to go*. It does
not mean the transfer is a good idea, that anybody has agreed, or that the
receiving project wants them.

**Both repositories must have their CI passing, and only one of those is
checkable from here.** Ours is: this runs as a CI job that depends on every
other job, so it cannot report green while anything else is red. **Theirs is
not, and this program will not pretend otherwise.** Asking GitHub about somebody
else's build from inside our build would make our CI fail for reasons in
somebody else's tree, which `docs/policy.md` names as the way a suite becomes
noise. So the other half is reported as **unverified from here** and is a
person's step with `--online`.

Exit codes follow `scripts/bump_check.py`, for the same reason it has three:

    0   ready       -- our side is in order, and where checked, theirs
    1   not ready   -- something named below is missing
    2   unverified  -- we could not ask, which is not a pass

**Roles move by being marked.** A role destined for another project carries a
`Destined for` line in `docs/roles.md`, and that marker is what this reads. **A
transfer nobody wrote down is not pending**, it is an intention.
